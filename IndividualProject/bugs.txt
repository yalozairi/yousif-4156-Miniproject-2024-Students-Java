-what the issue you fixed was, where it was, and if it has a proper name identified by a static analyzer what that name was

First Victim:
Where: Course Class
Issue Fixed: enrollStudent() did not properly check if the course was full & always returned false, or if the enrollment was successful

Victim 2:
Where: Course Class
Issue Fixed: dropStudent() now properly checks if a student is in the course and if the drop was successful

Victim 3:
Where: Course Class
Issue Fixed: isCourseFull() had the wrong logic, I made it so that if the students are >= to the limit, the course is marked as full (it returns true)

Victim 4:
Where: Course Class, Line 22
Issue Fixed: made it so that enrolledStudentCount actually starts at zero rather than 500

Victim 5:
Where: Course Class, getInstructorName
Issue Fixed: it would get the class location, changed to return the instructor's name

Victim 6:
Where: Course Class, getCourseLocation
Issue Fixed: it would get the instructor name, changed to return the course location
