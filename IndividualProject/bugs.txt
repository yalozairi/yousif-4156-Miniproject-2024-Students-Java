Bug Hitlist X(

-what the issue you fixed was, where it was, and if it has a proper name identified by a static analyzer what that name was

First Victim:
Where: Course Class
Issue Fixed: enrollStudent() did not properly check if the course was full & always returned false, or if the enrollment was successful

Victim 2:
Where: Course Class
Issue Fixed: dropStudent() now properly checks if a student is in the course and if the drop was successful

Victim 3:
Where: Course Class
Issue Fixed: isCourseFull() had the wrong logic, I made it so that if the students are >= to the limit, the course is marked as full (it returns true)

Victim 4:
Where: Course Class, Line 22
Issue Fixed: made it so that enrolledStudentCount actually starts at zero rather than 500

Victim 5:
Where: Course Class, getInstructorName
Issue Fixed: it would get the class location, changed to return the instructor's name

Victim 6:
Where: Course Class, getCourseLocation
Issue Fixed: it would get the instructor name, changed to return the course location

Victim 7:
Where: Department.java toString
Issue Fixed: return "result.toString()" hilariously returned that exact string, rather than the actual value

Victim 8:
Where: Route Controller, handleException
Issue Fixed: The return value returned http status OK. this was changed to the 404 error NOT_FOUND

Victim 9:
Where:
Issue Fixed:

Victim 10:
Where: RouteController, getMajorCtFromDept
Issue Fixed: The status FORBIDDEN was returned in the case where the department was not found. Changed this to NOT_FOUND
